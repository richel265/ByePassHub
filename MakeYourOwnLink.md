### Making links via freeDNS
1. Go to https://freedns.afraid.org/, if it's blocked, try this on another device (you can't put the site through an unblocker, it won't work.)
2. This is probably your first time, so click "Sign Up for Free." If you already have an account, go to step 5.
3. Fill out all of the information in the boxes.
	> For your first and last name, use anything.
	
	> For the user ID,  you can put anything, make sure it's unique.
	
	> **For your email, you could use a temporary email provider like [TempMail](https://temp-mail.org/) or [SmailPro](https://smailpro.com/) so you can create more links in the future, and its much safer.**
	
4. Press sign-up after filling the boxes, and complete the email activation. 
	> It might get bugged out and have an error. If so, just continue to the next step and sign in there.
5. After making an account, now we are going to register the link. Go to this page in freeDNS: https://freedns.afraid.org/domain/registry
	> Alternatively, press "Subdomains" on the left side of the page, then "Add subdomain", then on the "Domain" box click on the dropdown, then click "many, many more." After that click "Shared Domain Registry" on the first sentence.
 > If you haven't already, sign in with your account.	

6. Click a domain link that you would like to use. (e.g. chickenkiller.com)
	> Make sure to select a domain that is unblocked for you. Domains that have a low popularity are probably unblocked. <br>
	> Also make sure that the domain is public.
7. In the configurations page, on the top make sure "A" record type is selected (it should be already).
8. Enter the name of the subdomain, it can be anything. (subdomainName.chosenDomain.com)
9. For the destination, it depends on what unblocker you want to use. You can try to googling it or joining discord servers, here is a helpful table I created:

   	> Some may not work. Try another if it doesn't work.

| Unblocker   |  Type | IP Destination |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Abyss     | Web browser|`5.161.43.35`     |
| Astroid   | Games, Unblocker, Emulators, Apps|`5.161.68.227`        |

| *May or may not work:* Tinf0il | Proxy, games, apsp | `129.213.65.72`|
| Other unblockers have specific tutorials in their discord servers. To find their discord server, go to the [Proxy Discord Servers section](https://github.com/wea-f/ByePassHub/blob/main/mainUnblockers.md#caution-many-of-these-servers-will-ban-you-for-leaking-leaks-publicly-use-it-for-private-use-only) in the main Unblockers file.  

10. After putting the IP destination to your subdomain, press "save." Complete the captcha. 
11. Wait a couple minutes for your site to register and go to the link you created (and make more if you want)!

### Make links with Vercel
Link: https://vercel.com/new/clone?repositoryurl=`ReplaceThisWithRepositoryURL`
1. Replace the filler with an unblocker repository. For example, vercel.com/new/clone?repositoryurl=https://github.com/dogenetwork/v4 for deploying a doge unblocker link. Here's more (you can find your own too):
	> Interstellar: `https://github.com/InterstellarNetwork/Interstellar` <br>
 	> Snorlax's Cave: `https://github.com/Snorlaxs-Cave/Snorlaxs-Cave-v2` <br>
 	> Artclass: `https://github.com/art-class/v4` <br>
 	> Utopia: `https://github.com/UtopiaUnblocker/Utopia` <br>
    	> Abyss Web: `https://github.com/AbyssServices/Abyss-Web` <br>
 	> Astroid: `https://github.com/VyperGroup/astroidv3` <br>
 	> Shuttle: `https://github.com/shuttlenetwork/shuttle` <br>
 	> Tinf0il: `https://github.com/Aluminum-Depot/Tinf0il-new` <br>
     	> Shadow Tabbed: `https://github.com/xnightless/Shadownetwork` <br>
2. Log in to your vercel account with Github, sign up if needed with Github (you will have to authorize).
3. In the "Create Git Repository," enter the repository name that will be linked to your unblocker, it can be anything.
4. Click "Create"
5. After a few moments, go to the link that you just created, which should be (repositoryName).vercel.app

### Make links with Render
(coming soon!)
IGNORE ALL OF THIS, Doesn't WORK.... <br>
Link: https://render.com/deploy?repo=(repositoryURL)
1. With the above link, substitute the repositoryURL with one of the below (you can find your own too):
 	> Interstellar: `https://github.com/InterstellarNetwork/Interstellar` <br>
 	> Snorlax's Cave: `https://github.com/Snorlaxs-Cave/Snorlaxs-Cave-v2` <br>
 	> Artclass: `https://github.com/art-class/v4` <br>
 	> Utopia: `https://github.com/UtopiaUnblocker/Utopia` <br>
    	> Abyss Web: `https://github.com/AbyssServices/Abyss-Web` <br>
 	> Astroid: `https://github.com/VyperGroup/astroidv3` <br>
 	> Shuttle: `https://github.com/shuttlenetwork/shuttle` <br>
 	> Tinf0il: `https://github.com/Aluminum-Depot/Tinf0il-new` <br>
  	> Doge Unblocker: `https://github.com/dogenetwork/v4` <br>
   	> Shadow Tabbed: `https://github.com/xnightless/Shadownetwork` <br>
2. Example: https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/Shadowproxynetwork/Shadownetwork
3. It will prompt you to sign in, sign up if needed. You should sign in/sign up with Github.
4. For the blueprint name, put anything
5. For the branch, keep it at `main`
